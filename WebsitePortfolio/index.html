                Hello! My name is Albie Tappenden, 
                I’m a student and I studied for 2 years at a Level 3 Diploma in 
                ‘Animation for Games and Media’, in which I went on to achieving a Merit in both years. 
                I am a 3D Generalist but specialise in hard surface modelling like vehicles and forms of weaponry. 
                Using my skills, I am now studying ‘Digital Media’ at The University West of England in Bristol. 
                See below to view some of my work from this year!

                        For my first piece, I have taken inspiration from the Hungarian-french artist Victor Vasarely 
                        who specialized in creating art that tricked the eyes most commonly, but for this specific piece 
                        i recreated a simplified version of his style by using coloured squares and circles inside them. 
                        And how when the page is refreshed, each time the colours will be new.

                    <p class="border py-3 px-3">
                        For my second, I was inspired by Sonia Delaunay, who was known for experimenting colours and shapes, 
                        with repetition to create visually appealing patterns. In my work I used code to randomize circles 
                        around the canvas as well as triangles with random rotation points. Again with my last piece my work 
                        is made so that when refreshed, it shows a new unique version whilst keeping all the colours.

                        And for my final, I came up with this one myself, I realized for my other pieces i used 
                        randomization in colours but for this one i wanted to keep just 2 colours as well as keeping the 
                        objects the same when the page was refreshed. I tried to look at an artist called Josef Albers for the 
                        resizing of shapes but his stuff just didn't show off what I wanted to create.

                        For this project we were tasked with creating a stylised Robot in Autodesk Maya with a poly count
                        of under 3000 polygons. Using my past skills it was a fun challenge as I hadnt made something with a 
                        maximum poly count before, but it was achievable and made me think more to be able to detail and still 
                        keep under the maximum, finishing the model with about 2,600 polys.

                        For the 3D model robot after fully creating it in Autodesk Maya and doing the UVs, I imported it into 
                        substance painter where i created all the textures for my robot, where i also created my own custom 
                        smart material using a base template of plastic scratches on a metal base, i changed the plastic to a 
                        more matte black to look like paint, and then swapped the metal to a darker shade of red with more 
                        metalness than roughness to give my robot a more of an evil look and like battle scars.

                        primary colours and gave each line a bit of a bend to confuse the brain
                        on how to see if the cube is being displayed inwards or outwards.

                        to top a dark shade to a lighter grade to give a sense of lighting.

                        in a fully 2D image.

                <p>
                    When creating the 3 p5.js projects I had a lot of fun thinking about what to do for the 3 words of contrast, 
                    random and repetition, so I first looked for references on different artists for example; the Hungarian-french 
                    artist Victor Vasarely who specialized in creating art that tricked the eyes most commonly, but for this specific 
                    piece i recreated a simplified version of his style by using coloured squares and circles inside them. And how when 
                    the page is refreshed, each time the colours will be new. Along with Sonia Delaunay, who was known for experimenting 
                    colours and shapes, with repetition to create visually appealing patterns. In my work I used code to randomize circles 
                    around the canvas as well as triangles with random rotation points. Again with my last piece my work is made so that 
                    when refreshed, it shows a new unique version whilst keeping all the colours. And then for my final I had more fun as
                    I wanted to do this one myself, I did firstly think that I could maybe reference it to a already-created artwork but I 
                    couldn't find any artists who had done that specific shapes and patterns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The coding part of the 3 projects was also a fun but challenging task, from help from past workshops I looked at code we had
                    learned and used it with other functions to be able to create what i wanted and needed, when showing my work to my lecturers
                    they were impressed and so made me more confident in my work but also told me that maybe i could included other stuff like
                    custom functions which I have been researching into and will be sure to try include in my reflective video essay when it is due.

                <p>
                    Starting off this project and overall module the worksheets were a big challenge, as learning multiple coding languages at once for 
                    other projects confused me at points of not knowing why i was having errors then realising i had just got the formatting wtrong, 
                    despite that having the worksheets was a massive increase to my skills and confidence when creating my own website, using the 
                    bootstrap template so i could use it for the responsivness of my website when resized on desktop and different sized monitors, 
                    using the bootstrap I also used the columns that were already in the template along with the titles. I researched other ways of 
                    adding details like a gradient fade for the top navbar but then didnt like it after viewing it on other sizes and so removed it.
                    I then learnt when adding padding what px and py meant, because before we were only taught what py-3 was, and I didnt understand 
                    what it was but then when i researched how to add padding onto the x axis of text i learnt that py was the y value and px is the 
                    x value, and so i added py-3 and px-3 along with a border to most of my text descriptions for easier readibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it came to creating the about me section I stumped at first on how to make sure the box would stick to the bottom of the page 
                    but after a bit of researching I easily found out how to do it along with a way to make it so when the user clicks on the names of 
                    my contacting ways, they would be redirected to the site, or, in my opinion the coolest one i found out, was when you click on my 
                    email option, you are sent to your emails and it automatically puts my email into the user you send an email to. Adding onto when I 
                    made the contact page I realised that on my navbar i had the contact me button but when clicking it it didn't actually go anywhere 
                    so I talked to my coursemate who knew how to do it and he taught me how to get it to work, in which i used that new skill to add it 
                    again under my contact page with a button that would scroll for the user back to the top of the page.
