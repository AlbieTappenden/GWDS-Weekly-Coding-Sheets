            <p class="lead text-center">Hello! My name is Albie Tappenden, 
                I’m a student and I studied for 2 years at a Level 3 Diploma in 
                ‘Animation for Games and Media’, in which I went on to achieving a Merit in both years. 
                I am a 3D Generalist but specialise in hard surface modelling like vehicles and forms of weaponry. 
                Using my skills, I am now studying ‘Digital Media’ at The University West of England in Bristol. 
                See below to view some of my work!</p>

                    <h4>Repetition</h4>
                    <p>For my first piece, I have taken inspiration from the Hungarian-french artist Victor Vasarely 
                        who specialized in creating art that tricked the eyes most commonly, but for this specific piece 
                        i recreated a simplified version of his style by using coloured squares and circles inside them. 
                        And how when the page is refreshed, each time the colours will be new.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <img src="images/RandomP5.png" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
                    <h4>Random</h4>
                    <p>For my second, I was inspired by Sonia Delaunay, who was known for experimenting colours and shapes, 
                        with repetition to create visually appealing patterns. In my work I used code to randomize circles 
                        around the canvas as well as triangles with random rotation points. Again with my last piece my work 
                        is made so that when refreshed, it shows a new unique version whilst keeping all the colours.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <img src="images/ContrastP5.png" class="img-fluid" alt="...">
                    <h4>Contrast</h4>
                    <p>And for my final, I came up with this one myself, I realized for my other pieces i used 
                        randomization in colours but for this one i wanted to keep just 2 colours as well as keeping the 
                        objects the same when the page was refreshed. I tried to look at an artist called Josef Albers for the 
                        resizing of shapes but his stuff just didn't show off what I wanted to create.</p>
