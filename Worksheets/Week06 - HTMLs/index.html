    <h1>Have you ever made a pizza from scratch?</h1>
    <h2>Yeah? no you haven't.</h2>

    <p>Making a pizza is similar to coding, except learning coding would be 
    similar to making 5,000,000 pizzas in 24 hours, impossible right?.
    Exactly, so learning coding in 24 hours is also impossible</p>
